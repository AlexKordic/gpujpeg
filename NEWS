2012-02-21
----------
Changes:
-Added option to encoder for generating segment info into APP13 header that is used
 by decoder to perform fast stream parsing.
-Renamed --interleving option to --interleaved and --chroma-subsampling to --subsampled.

2012-02-16
----------
Changes:
-Added option for verbose output from console application.
-Library now stores all coder time durations inside coder structure and it
 can be accessed from userspace.
-Console application now prints GPU allocation info (when --verbose is used).
-Correction of encoding/decoding for large images (e.g. 4320p or 8K)

2012-02-07
----------
-Improved preprocessor and postprocessor performance.
-Added recovering from error inside JPEG stream to decoder.
-Library provides function for listing CUDA devices.
-Library provides option for decoder to output result right into OpenGL PBO resource
 which improves performance when the result should be displayed on the same GPU.
 -Correction of build warnings.
 -Correction of other errors.

2012-01-04
----------
Changes:
-Added option to libgpujpeg Makefile for moving gpu huffman coder tables into constant memory.
-Option is default set to true and makes better performance on older GPUs.

2012-01-03
----------
Changes:
-Added interleaved mode (optionally).
-Added subsampling (optionally) - better performance when used 
 (because of smaller amount of encoded/decoded data).

2011-12-07
----------
First public release of gpujpeg library and console 
application.
Features:
-Baseline JPEG, non-interleaved mode on CUDA-enabled GPUs.
-Performance - realtime HD and 4K encoding/decoding on NVIDIA GTX 580.
-Using CUDA and NPP library.
